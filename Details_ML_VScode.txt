1 - Setup the Github Repository
	a)Create a new environment
	b)create a setup.py
	c)create requirements.txt

Here, I will VS code to do the coding and push the commits using command prompt as git is not working properly from VS code.

2 - Data Ingestion
3 - Data Transformation
4 - Build the ML Model
5 - Model Evaluation
6 - Model Deployment
7 - Model Monitoring

Working with conda and VS code:
-------------------------------
1. Open Anaconda command prompt
2. Goto the folder where you will be working
3. run "code ."

(base) C:\Users\arnchand>cd C:\Users\arnchand\Desktop\Important Doc\Machine-Learning\MLOps\End-to-End-Project

(base) C:\Users\arnchand\Desktop\Important Doc\Machine-Learning\MLOps\End-to-End-Project>code .

4. VS code opens
5. Hover over to terminal and open terminal
6. create a python environment
conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
where 'venv' is the environment name

Activate the environment:
conda activate venv/

->Create a Repo in github and initialize it.
->Create the README.md and push it to the repo
->Create a .gitignore file for python (this will remove all the irrelvant info from the python file while we push our code into git)
	->Go to repo
	->Click on Add file->new file
	->Give the file name '.gitignore'
	->Give the .gitignore template as python
	->Click on Commit changes
	->Go to cmd and run git pull origin main ---- You will be able to see the .gitignore file in the directory
->Create setup.py and requirements.txt files

'requirements.txt' file will contain all the libraries and packages required for the ML project that needs to be installed
->'requirements.txt' will have '-e .' which will enable it to trigger setup.py
'setup.py' will be responsible for creating the ML application as a package and deploy it anywhere

->Create a new folder as src and create '__init__.py' file. This will help the setup.py to identify the folder for which the application needs to be created

-> RUN pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal -- you will see all the packages getting installed

->Now create 'components' folder under src -> This folder is used to create all the modules like data ingestion,model,model_evaluation etc.
We will also create a '__init__.py' file so that it is created as a package and can be used in the overall application whenever called for.

->Create 'data_ingestion.py','data_transformation.py','model_training.py' file under components folder

-> Similarly create pipeline module under 'src' with 'train_pipeline.py' and 'predict_pipeline.py' and initialize with '__init__.py' file

->Now create 3 more files under 'src' which are important:
1. logger.py : For log purpose
2. exception.py : For exception handling
3. utils.py : For functions which will be used globally by the application (e.g. suppose I want to read data from a database, you can create your mongoDB client here or you want to save the model on to a cloud, we can use this space)
