* This project aims at building a simple web ML application using HTML which takes various students data to predict the subject score.
* I have approached in buidling a modular code which is easy to understand and clearly defined
* The code also compares various regression algorithm performance metrics result to select the best ML algorithm during training process and utilize the same for prediction purpose.
* The application is deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk service by integrating our github repo. With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those services.
